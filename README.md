[Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) plugin that exposes the Apple TV to HomeKit with much richer features than the vanilla Apple TV integration of HomeKit.

This plugin automatically discovers Apple TV devices on the local network and exposes each one as a HomeKit Set-Top Box.

## Features

-   Automatically discover Apple TVs in your local network.
-   Pairing process without the need to access the command line like with other plugins.
-   Change the current App by selecting an input in HomeKit.
    -   The plugin is developed in a way that makes it possible to rename, hide or show inputs in HomeKit natively ... and saves it.
    -   You can even define own inputs based on URIs in the configuration. For instance, you can create an input to open a certain Disney+ movie or show ... or pretty much anything you can think of. Take a look at the example `config.json` ;).
-   The automation triggers that you are probably here for ...
    -   Since every Apple TV is exposed as a Set-Top Box, you can create a trigger on the power state to execute automations when turning on or off.
    -   For each media type (music, video, tv and unknown) the plugin will create a motion sensor (media types can be hidden or shown by changing the configuration).
    -   For each device state (idle, playing, loading, seeking, paused, stopped) the plugin will create a motion sensor (device states can be hidden or shown by changing the configuration).
-   A fully functional and super fast remote in the remote app of your iPhone or iPad.
    -   Remote keys can also be exposed as switches.
-   Absolute volume control via a fan accessory.
-   If you do not want all Apple TVs to be exposed, it is possible to blacklist them by providing the MAC-Address.
-   "Avada Kedavra" which is exposed as an input to close all apps.

It might also be a good idea to take a look at [this video](https://www.tiktok.com/@b_turner50/video/7330389563946339589) to get an idea what this plugin is all about.

## Requirements

-   Only Linux will be supported by the maintainer (although since MacOS / UNIX is similar to Linux, it should run on MacOS just fine)
-   Most recent Version of Node 20 LTS or 18 LTS
-   Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12
-   Python virtual environment module `virtualenv`. (the plugin will create a virtual environment on startup and will install python dependencies in this virtual environment)
    -   On homebridge **[apt-package >=1.1.4](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-apt-pkg/releases/tag/1.1.4)** the python module is installed automatically as a dependency, see [homebridge/homebridge-apt-pkg#16](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-apt-pkg/issues/16)
        -   **[raspian image >= 1.1.2](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-raspbian-image/releases/tag/v1.1.2)** includes this apt-package, so there is no need to install it manually.
        -   **[homebridge-docker >= 2023-11-28](https://github.com/homebridge/docker-homebridge/releases/tag/2023-11-28)** includes this apt-package, so there is no need to install it manually.
    -   Otherwise, the python module `virtualenv` has to be installed manually. This won't be handled by the plugin itself.
        -   On debian-based distros: `sudo apt install python3-venv`
        -   Installation on other distros may vary
-   [Homebridge Config UI >= 4.54.2](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-config-ui-x/releases/tag/4.54.2) when creating backups
-   OpenSSL 3 or later
    -   If an older OpenSSL version is installed, the plugin will automatically boot into an OpenSSL legacy compatibility mode. Be aware that this mode does not support Python 3.12.
-   Apple TV Models with tvOS 15 and upwards are supported (all 4K ones and the latest HD one)
-   The access of Speakers & TVs should be either set to "Everybody" or "Anybody On the Same Network" in the Home app
    -   Additionally, make sure to check the TV's HomeKit settings.
-   Raspberry Pi 1, 2, 3 and Zero 1, 2 are not recommended for performance reasons. Recommended are 3B+, 4B, 5B.
-   The homebridge instance and Apple TVs need to be on the same subnet.
-   32 bit systems are not supported
    -   Certain python packages that are required are not available as 32 bit binaries. Thus, it is required to install tooling to compile the packages. This includes 32 bit systems in a 64 bit userspace. (If you know what you are doing, you can install build dependencies and compile the packages yourself. However, this is not supported by the plugin officially)
    -   see [issue #236](https://github.com/maxileith/homebridge-appletv-enhanced/issues/236).
-   [HOOBS](https://github.com/hoobs-org/HOOBS) is not supported.
    -   HOOBS is a 32 bit architecture and suffers from the above limitations.
    -   HOOBS has a different plugin system that prevents managing Apple TVs.

## Pairing

1.  Install the plugin.
2.  (optional) Enable the plugin to run as a child bridge. The benefit here is that the plugin is more isolated from other plugins, e.g. in case of a plugin crash, only the plugin will crash and not the whole homebridge.
3.  Restart the homebridge.
4.  (optional) If the plugin is running as a child bridge, the child bridge will now be exposed. You can add it to your Home App if you want to. However, there is no real benefit to it since this bridge will not expose any devices (Apple TVs will be exposed as their own bridges).
5.  The plugin will start the discovery of Apple TVs in your local network.
6.  For every discovered Apple TV you have to do the following steps. Make sure you are in front of your TV. The paring process is the same that is used to pair iPhones and iPads and will timeout after 30 seconds.
    1. In the logs there will be a message thats says `You need to pair your Apple TV before the plugin can connect to it. pen the webpage http://192.168.0.12:42015/. Then, enter the pairing code that will be displayed on your Apple TV.` where the link [http://192.168.0.12:42015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is different in your log and distinct for one Apple TV if you are connecting multiple.
    2. Open the link. A pairing page will open (see first image below).
    3. In the meantime there should already be a pairing code displayed on your Apple TV. Enter the 4-digit code into the pairing page. You have 30 seconds to enter the pairing code.
        - If you miss that timeframe, you can just click the "Tap to retry" button and initiate another pairing request.
        - If you enter a wrong code, the pairing request will fail and another pairing request is started **automatically**.
        - If the pairing requests fails to often due to too many incorrect entered codes or too many timed out requests, the Apple TV will start a "Back Off Timer" which blocks all pairing request for a certain period. This is period is set by the Apple TV, not the plugin. Restarting or reinstalling the plugin won't reset the timer.
    4. Done ... do this with all your Apple TVs.
7.  You have paired all Apple TVs (with the plugin, not with Apple Home yet).
8.  Every Apple TV is exposed as an Apple TV device and is its own bridge. Therefore, we need to add every Apple TV separately to Apple Home. In order to do that, open the Home app, go to add devices > more options, then type in the pairing code from the logs (Logs: `Please add [Apple TV Wohnzimmer (2)] manually in
Home app. Setup Code: xxxx-xxxx` this is not the code that you have seen on the Apple TV display).

## Configuration

The easiest way to configure this plugin is to use [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x).

To configure it manually, add the following to the `platforms` section of Homebridge's `config.json` after installing the plugin.

Also see [device specific overrides](https://github.com/maxileith/homebridge-appletv-enhanced/blob/main/docs/md/deviceSpecificOverrides.md).

| `avadaKedavraAppAmount`      | How many apps should be closed when selecting the Avada Kedavra Input? Avada Kedavra works by sending a sequence of remote control inputs to the Apple TV. The plugin therefore acts blindly and does not receive any feedback when all apps are closed. So if a high number is selected, the plugin presses the remote control until theoretically x apps are closed, although in reality all apps are already closed.                                                                        | `integer`       | 5 - 35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | `15`                                                        |

| `autoUpdate`                 | Apple TV Enhanced will update itself automatically once there is an update available. Change the "Update Check Level" to install or leave out betas. It is recommended to operate this plugin as a child bridge if enabling this functionality since the plugin will automatically restart the bridge after updating (the whole homebridge if it the plugin is not running as its own child bridge). By default, auto updating is turned on when operating AppleTV Enhanced as a child bridge. | `string`        | `on`, `off`, _undefined_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `on` if the plugin acts as a child bridge, otherwise `off`. |
| `pythonExecutable`           | Here you can specify a path that points to a python executable. The plugin uses the systems default python as default. Setting a specific python executable here may be required if your systems default python version is too current for the plugin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `string`        | valid absolute path                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `python3` from PATH                                         |

## Known Issues

-   Apple TVs report a MAC-Address that is different from the MAC-Address that you will see in the network settings of your Apple TV when scanning for devices. Therefore, when blacklisting Apple TVs use the MAC-Address from the logs.
-   If using audio output devices other than the Apple TV itself, the Apple TV is always reported as powered on. This is a known issue of the dependency [pyatv](https://pyatv.dev), see [postlund/pyatv#1667](https://github.com/postlund/pyatv/issues/1667). As a result, the Apple TV device will only be shown as off in HomeKit when powered off via the Apple TV device in HomeKit. After restarting the plugin the device will always be shown as on.
-   See also [open bugs](https://github.com/maxileith/homebridge-appletv-enhanced/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).
