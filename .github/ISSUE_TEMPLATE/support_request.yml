        Hi. Before you start filling out this form be aware of the following points:
        - Review our **Troubleshooting** and **FAQ** pages in the Wiki to ensure your issue isn't already solved by those steps.
        - Search through **existing issues** (resolved or open) which might provide a solution to your problem already.
        - If your issue is **plugin specific**, raise an issue with the plugin author on their GitHub page instead.
        - **Ask the community**: We have a Discord and a Reddit. Active community members might provide help quicker on those platforms.
